#Chord Image Generator

Chord Image Generator is a small .NET library to generate images of guitar chords. It can display chord boxes, starting frets, barred chords, fingerings and open and muted strings.

<small>(Because my web hosting is now run on Linux these images are generated by Mono. They don't look quite as good as those created on Windows. See the blog post above for a comparison)</small>

There is a small example website at [http://chords.einaregilsson.com](http://chords.einaregilsson.com) where you can try different chords and see how they are constructed. But basically it is just done by constructing the right url of the form /chordname/fret-positions/fingerings/size . E.g. the chords above are the following urls:

* [http://chords.einaregilsson.com/D/xx0232/---132/3](http://chords.einaregilsson.com/D/xx0232/---132/3)
* [http://chords.einaregilsson.com/A/x02220/--123-/3](http://chords.einaregilsson.com/A/x02220/--123-/3)
* [http://chords.einaregilsson.com/A_5/577655/134211/3](http://chords.einaregilsson.com/A_5/577655/134211/3)

There is nothing web specific about the actual image generation. It can be saved to any stream so you could just as easily use it in a desktop application.
